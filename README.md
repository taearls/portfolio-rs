# Hire Me!
I'm currently between full-time positions. I have experience working on frontend applications with React and Vue, and I have backend experience in Node and Java. I have been learning Rust (which this website is written in) independently for 2 years as well.

I have a passion for learning new things and I'm always looking to learn more. If you're hiring, or if you simply want to say hello, please feel free to email me at [tyler.a.earls@gmail.com](mailto:tyler.a.earls@gmail.com).

# Portfolio
This repository is the source code for my tech portfolio, built lovingly with [Yew](https://www.yew.rs), a web framework written in Rust. I also use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) in my components, and [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) to serve static images that are optimized for the web.

This is a rewrite of the [original version](https://github.com/taearls/portfolio-nuxt) of this website, which is written with [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org). For now, I've decided to deprecate that project, but in the future I may upgrade it to Nuxt 3.x once that is production-ready.
